# 2 learnings here, Continue and break, wrote my own script to get better understanding
1. Continue is used along with not = , if its not equal to your variable , this script will keep asking you tpye your name
2. if the password is awesome then it breaks from loop or else it will keep you asking type name again


while True:

    name = input("Type your name?\n")
    if name != 'Jouhar':
        continue
    print(f"hello {name}, what is the password?")
    password = input("""type password \n""")
    if password == 'awesome':
        break
    print("Successfull")
